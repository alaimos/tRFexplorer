                            <CardText>tRFexplorer is a public database through which users may display the expression profile of tRNA-derived ncRNAs in every cell
                                line of NCI-60. The system allows to perform correlation analyses of tRNA-derived ncRNAs expression with all omics data and compound activities
                                available on CellMiner. This provides an important opportunity to investigate their potential biological roles in absence of direct experimental
                                evidences.</CardText>
                            <CardText>The database reports 143 distinct tRNA-derived ncRNAs, categorized in tRNA-derived fragments (9 tRF-5s, 45 tRF-3s),
                                tRNA-derived small RNAs (75 tsRNAs), and tRNA 5’ leader RNAs (14 sequences identified). This latter group represents an additional evidence of
                                tRNA-derived ncRNAs originating from the 5’ leader region of precursor tRNA, a class of tRNA-derived small RNAs currently poorly
                                investigated.</CardText>
